## Title :
### Bootcamp Group Project 2

## Project :
### *Studdy Buddy*

## Description :
* This is a group project created using Handlebars, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Express, Handlebars, Sequelize, and Bcrypt
* Studdy Buddy is an application that pairs users looking to partner with a peer to work through a selected course topic, based on how they match up via a self ranking system.


## Working :
* "Create Account" field stores users credentials and redirects to the assessment page
* "Login to Profile" field redirects user to their user profile
* "Update Assessments" field stores users entered scores (both initial and updated) into a database
* Database compares scores and matches user who is seeking a buddy (when "Find a Buddy" button is selected) to user who is waiting to help a buddy (when "Help a Buddy" button is selected) and is scored above the user who is seeking a buddy 
* Chat box deploys between the paired users once a match is made
* "Logout" button allows user to leave the chat conversation and/or to logout of the application

## Usage :
* Open the intial interface deployed through Heroku
* The user can then create an account in the login page by completing the username and password fields
* They'll complete a self-assessment, ranking their confidence level among the listed course topics
* They'll click "find a buddy" to be paired with a peer who is ranked above them in the selected topic, to provide sufficent thought-partnering support
* They can click "help a buddy" to be put in a queue that will match them with someone who is looking for a buddy
* When there is a match they will be automatically moved into a chat conversation to start working with their partner
* They can click "logout" once they would like to leave the conversation
* The user can also update their assessment scores as often as they advance through any listed course topic, using the "update assessment" button
* They can also log back in with their user credentials when they would like to open a new buddy search or chat session


## User Story :
As a student, I want to be paired with a study partner to work together on a topic that I am struggling with and they can provide support in

## Acceptance Criteria :
- Given I open the Studdy Buddy application, then I am prompted to create a user account
- When I provide my credentials
- Then I am taken to a topic assessment page
- When I select my topic scores
- Then those scores are stored in a database and compared to other users' scores
- When I select "find a buddy"
- Then the database pairs me with a partner that is scored above me in the selected topic and I am automatically moved into a chat conversation with my matched partner
- When I have received the support I needed 
- Then I can leave the conversation
- When I want to return to a session
- Then I can log back in to my account where my scores are stored
- When I have advanced in a particular topic
- Then I can update my scores
- When I want to lend support to somebody else
- Then I can click "help a buddy" to be in queue to help the next person in need of study support
