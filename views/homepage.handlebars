  <p id='homepage-text'>Have you ever been struggling in class but you don't
    know who to reach out to? Introducing Studdy Buddy, an application that
    allows you to connect with your peers to discuss and work on different
    topics together. Users are able to rate their understanding of topics on a
    scale of 1-5 and these scores are used to pair you with someone who
    understands the topic better than yourself. This allows students to learn
    from their peers and work together to solve problems rather than have to
    rely on an outside tutor or having to ask the teacher. Users can also choose
    to be the ones that provide help to their peers with the click of a button.
    Students connect in a chat room where they may discuss what they are
    struggling with.</p>
